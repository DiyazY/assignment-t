# CHANGELOG
* 05.10.2022
  * ReactJs is selected as a frontend "framework" because it is my preferred lib for frontend development. Additionally, Material UI library was chosen for fast flow development because it provides a good set of components which are already styled. 
  * Asp.Net Core framework is selected as the backend framework because it has many features out of the box and very good documentation.
